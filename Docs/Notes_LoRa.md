# LoRa

`LoRa` (Long Range) is a wireless communication technology designed for long-range, low-power communication between devices. 

- It uses spread spectrum modulation techniques to allow long-range communications.
- `LoRa` can transmit data over distances of several kilometers with low power consumption, making it ideal for applications such as `IoT`(Internet of Things).

# LoRaWAN and The Things Network
`LoRaWAN(Long Range Wide Area Network)` is a protocol built on top of `LoRa` technology that provides a standardized way for devices to communicate with `LoRa` gateways and cloud services.

`TTN (The Things Network)` is a global network that provides `LoRaWAN` connectivity for `IoT` devices. 
It is a public, open-source allowing anyone to connect their devices to the internet for free. 
`TTN` provides infrastructure such as gateways and servers to enable data exchange between `LoRaWAN` devices and applications.
Using `TTN` with `LoRaWAN` allows `IoT` devices to connect to the internet and communicate with cloud-based services. 
`TTN` provides a simple, cost-effective way for developers and organizations to build `IoT` applications and services that require long-range, low-power connectivity.
