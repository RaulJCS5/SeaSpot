# LILYGOÂ® TTGO T-Beam v1.0 (868 MHz) AND TTN (The Things Network)
## LoRaWAN data transmission.

This Python code uses LoRaWAN technology to send data wirelessly over a LoRa network using ABP (Activation By Personalisation) authentication method. The LoRa module is initialized in LoRaWAN mode, and the region is set to EU868. ABP authentication parameters are created, including Device Address, NwkSKey, and AppSKey.

        # create an ABP authentication params
        # your application Device address
        dev_addr = struct.unpack(">l", binascii.unhexlify('11111111'))[0]

        app_swkey = binascii.unhexlify('11111111111111111111111111111111')
        # join a network using ABP (Activation By Personalisation)
        lora.join(activation=LoRa.ABP, auth=(dev_addr, nwk_swkey, app_swkey))
        # wait until the module has joined the network
        while not lora.has_joined():
            time.sleep(2.5)
            print('Not yet joined...')
        # saving the state
        lora.nvram_save()
        # returning whether the join was successful
        if lora.has_joined():
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        return True
# joining TTN
join_lora(True)
# wait until the module has joined the network
while not lora.has_joined():
    time.sleep(2.5)
    print('Not yet joined...')
# create a LoRa socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_LORA, socket.SOCK_RAW)
# set the LoRaWAN data rate
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_LORA, socket.SO_DR, 5)
# make the socket non-blocking
s.setblocking(False)
# send some data
s.send(bytes([0x06,0x08]))
```

After joining the network, a LoRa socket is created, and the LoRaWAN data rate is set. The socket is made non-blocking, and the code sends some data in bytes ([0x06, 0x08]).

In summary, this code establishes a connection to a LoRaWAN network and sends some data wirelessly over the network using a LoRa module.
